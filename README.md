# CAP-ES-Pamphlet

This pamphlet is intended to function as a guidebook for aspiring Emergency Services Professionals in the Civil Air Patrol. There are many misconceptions that I've run across in my time at the squadron, group, and wing level that have led me to believe that a common document, though non-directive, may be useful in getting people rapidly onboarded, qualified, and active in the program. 

Some important notes about this document:

1. Wherever possible, I will reference [Primary Source Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source) in order to allow individuals a place to go when someone identifies a potential conflicting document to the information in this one.
	1. Acronyms will be defined before first use to minimize confusion.
2. While the primary goal is qualification and activity in the Emergency Services Specialty Track, by simple virtue of pursuing this you will also be completing tasks that are duplicated in other Specialty Tracks such as Operations, Communications, Safety, and more.
3. Pilots, before continuing further, should use the well written [Pilot Onboarding Pamphlet](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/P_7012_409CE123DCDE2.pdf) as their guide, it is updated and well written for the task of getting you mission capable as fast as possible. Upon completing that reading and building a plan accordingly, this pamphlet will still be useful for higher level qualifications at the mission base such as Air Operations Branch Director. Non-pilots can also benefit from a review of the documentation there. Part 1 is especially useful for all members learning to navigate our online [e-Services web portal](https://capnhq.gov/).

For some quick explanatory items for new members: [National CAP Regulations](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/members/publications/indexes-regulations-and-manuals-1700) will be referred to as CAPRs for brevity. [National Pamphlets](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/members/publications/pamphlets-1702) will be referred to as CAPPs. 

Regulation specifics are generally referred to by the reg number, chapter, and paragraph. 

For example: [CAPR 60-3](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R060_003_075A4369FBA8E.pdf), 1-18, d. “All CAP personnel, regardless of unit or rank, will give the IC complete support and cooperation.”

To find this citation you would go to the [CAP Regulations page](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R060_003_075A4369FBA8E.pdf) either by that direct link or by navigating to gocivilairpatrol.com, choosing the "Members" section from the top blue bar, hovering over "Publications Library", and clicking on "Indexes, Regulations, and Manuals".

From there you would click on the regulation number mentioned, review the table of contents for the chapter, go to that chapter in the PDF (some are hyperlinked and can be navigated to by clicking on the chapter listed in the table of contents) and from there scrolling to the relevant paragraph.

Depending on what state your squadron is in, you may also be subject to Region and Wing Supplements. Those can be located [here](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/members/publications/approved-supplements-and-ois-by-region).

With the above in mind, let's dive right into the things you should care about before we jump right into the checklists.


==Above all else, use the following regulation as your guide!==

**[CAP REGULATION 1-1, ETHICS POLICY](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R001_001_AACFE68A86CC5.pdf)**

It's only 2 pages. Read it. Then read it again. It's the first regulation for a reason. If you aren't doing the right thing, the right way, at the right time, and you aren't documenting it so that your actions are unassailable by others at a later time, at some point you are going to have a problem. And if the problem is big enough, it's going to become more than just your problem. 

You may note that if you glanced at the [Pilot Onboarding Pamphlet](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/P_7012_409CE123DCDE2.pdf) I mentioned earlier, there is a section right at the front on Aircrew Professionalism. Such standards are just as important for the ground teams and mission base staff on an assignment. The Department of the Air Force recognizes the value of our service in two ways: It provides us authorization to operate as their Civilian Auxiliary, and in recognition of our service in the past, present, and future, it authorizes us to wear a distinctive Air Force Uniform and use Air Force equipment, real property, military radio frequencies, and more. Take that recognition and permission as serious as they do.

The other regulations you should pay attention to that aren't directly related to Emergency Services?

[CAP REGULATION 1-2, PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R001_002_15BAF8B12FA4B.pdf)

[CAP REGULATION 1-3, DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY VOLUNTEER MEMBERS](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R001_003_CE7FDA295EED7.pdf)

[CAP REGULATION 1-4, CONFLICT OF INTEREST](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R001_004_4418C23B01F01.pdf)

You might be able to guess the contents of the above just by their titles. I'll distill the importance of these for you right here:

1. Protect confidential information.
2. Don't disclose confidential information.
3. Don't talk out of turn, especially to non-CAP members
4. When you aren't sure what to do about a potential issue, TALK TO YOUR IMMEDIATE COMMANDER!
	1. Note: When on a mission, your immediate commander is the person placed as your supervisor on the mission. That chain of command goes up to the mission Incident Commander (hereafter IC.) You are under their operational control, not your administratively assigned unit commander. (CAPR 60-3, 1-18, d. “All CAP personnel, regardless of unit or rank, will give the IC complete support and cooperation.”)
		1. See also the CAP Pamphlet on Emergency Services, specifically on the definitions of ADCON, OPCON, and TACON.

To recap: Do the right thing at the right place at the right time, and document the same at the time you do it. Obey your officers. Report your concerns using your chain of command as defined by your current situation.

And if things just don't seem right, remember that as a volunteer you always have the right to decline an assignment. There are of course consequences for doing so, but maintaining an ethical stance and enduring the consequences is always better than taking an unethical path and enduring THOSE consequences.

A fast rule of thumb on if you should obey an order given to you:

Is the order:

1. Unsafe?
2. Illegal?
3. Immoral?
4. Unethical?

Any of those could constitute reasons to decline an assignment. That said, some of these choices can be individual and subjective. By way of example, a task that is unsafe for one person lacking training, expertise, and/or physical ability might be safe for another person to engage in that has the training, expertise, and physical ability to do the task. Remember that when relaying any concerns.

If there is a concern you think that should be brought up, also remember this:

It is better to identify and solve the problems that can crop up in an training mission vs a live mission.

And it is always better to have more training than less.

---

Now with all of the above laid out, let's talk about Emergency Services Qualifications.

There are two domains of qualifications to concern yourself with.

1. Specialty Track Ratings
	1. None (Trainee), Technician, Senior, Master
2. Specialty Qualifications
	1. Mission Staff Assistant, Mission Radio Operator, Ground Team Member, etc.


The former primarily will affect your ability to promote within the organization and help to determine your suitability for leadership roles. The latter will affect your ability to deploy on missions. Many highly qualified members never complete the former while having served on hundreds of missions. That said, it is my belief that one should complete the rating regardless of choosing to promote as this is one of the few badges that cadets can earn as well as senior members in the organization, and completing it provides you the framework to help THEM complete it. As such this pamphlet will cover achieving both items through the Technician Rating for the Specialty Track and the basic Specialty Qualifications.

---

And now, without further ado, let's dive into what you are probably actually here reading this document for: The checklists on how to become qualified as fast as possible while being as useful as possible on missions!

The first thing to realize: Not all of the training you require is provided by CAP. In the aftermath of 9/11, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 required that ALL first responders, including volunteers, have a basic level of training that was the same across the entire nation. That training became known as the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and completing the appropriate NIMS training became known as being NIMS Compliant. This training is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA.)

This training is a combination of online and in-person training. The first bits of training we will worry about are online.

But before you can take any of that training, you need to apply for and receive a FEMA student ID (sometimes called the FEMA SID).

***NOTICE***
Before proceeding, be aware that nearly all CAP wings now provide official emails to their members for official business. When applying for and completing training, you will find it easier over time to have all of your training logged under one email address. I suggest waiting for your CAP email address to be activated before training, or if you are quick to take online classes and don't want to wait, take the time to update your email address in the training systems.

So, to apply for your FEMA SID, you'll want to start by going [here](https://cdp.dhs.gov/femasid/register). Once you register, make sure you keep a record of your security questions and SID. I suggest using a password manager that allows you to save notes securely to store this data.

Next, apply for an account at https://login.gov as FEMA will be migrating to this for authentication in the near future. You'll want to set this up on your personal email account, then add your CAP email to this as a secondary email.

With this done, you can now [take the FEMA training](https://training.fema.gov/is/), take the FEMA tests, and receive your certificates.

The Big Four classes to get out of the way are the NIMS (National Incident Management System) classes, sometimes called the ICS (Incident Command System) classes even though only two of them are actually about ICS:

| Course Code   | Course Title                                                                                                                                        | CEUs |

If you've taken these classes before, please note the course dates: They do get updated and FEMA generally requires that you have the latest class completed to take more advanced classes in person and/or become a trainer of classes.

Beyond these classes, the following are optional and provide either perspective on specific areas of ES or are pre-requisites for higher tier classes. If you are in a test taking mood, hammer these out!

I suggest completing this block of classes first as they comprise the online group of classes known as the [FEMA Professional Development Series (PDS)](https://training.fema.gov/is/searchis.aspx?search=PDS). If you complete the above classes and these, you will have met nearly all the requirements for attending the [FEMA National Emergency Management Basic Academy.](https://training.fema.gov/programs/empp/basic/#prerequisites)

The FEMA PDS classes are as follows:

| Course Code | Course Title                                                                                           | CEUs |

| IS-244.b    | [Developing and Managing Volunteers](https://training.fema.gov/IS/courseOverview.aspx?code=IS-244.b)   | 0.4  |
The one additional class you need to qualify for the Basic Academy is[ IS-29, Public Information Officer Awareness.](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-29.a&lang=en)

The remaining FEMA classes that CAP cares about on the IS side at this time for certain specialized training are as follows:

| Course Code | Course Title                                                                                                                                                    | CEUs |

It's at this point I'm going to quote CAPR 60-3 2-1 Paragraph b with regards to training:

=="Training should not stop with initial qualification since professional performance demands continuous training."==

Do not content yourself with simply completing the minimums of training! There are many opportunities to learn and this training can provide some surprising crosswalks to your daily life and jobs.

Now I'm going to switch gears to Civil Air Patrol classes. The reason I lead with the FEMA classes? Sometimes when a member joins or is waiting to join, life, paperwork, and surprises can delay access to the CAP e-Services online platform. When that happens, new and prospective members are left spinning their wheels and waiting for an opportunity to do something. The longer that happens, the more likely the new members disengage. Thus, I lead with something that they can do RIGHT NOW.

With that said, let's now talk about the online training at [e-Services](https://capnhq.gov/). At this point I'm assuming someone at your squadron has shown you the ropes when it comes to logging in and hopefully some basic navigation. That said I will utilize hyperlinks whenever possible to get you directly to courses, or where that isn't possible, to the closest link in the learning platform to get there.

With that in mind, now that you have an active membership and account, please send the following email to your SQUADRON commander, adjusted for your name, their name, etc.:

---

Good morning Commander,

I am interested in supporting the Emergency Services Mission within our organization. I have completed several FEMA classes and I'm now taking the General Emergency Services classes on e-Services. At your convenience, please place me into the following Specialty Tracks for my professional development training:

	1. Emergency Services
	2. Communications
	3. Safety

As I prepare for assuming duties in a trainee capacity, I'd like to discuss being placed as an assistant in the Emergency Services Officer and assistant Communications Officer role and would like an introduction to our current people leading those roles for the purpose of learning how we work within our squadron and to help me find a local mentor.

Very Respectfully,

[Your signature block](https://cap-signature-generator.netlify.app/)
(This link goes to a site that will automatically format your signature appropriately. Take the time to design it, save it, and use it for CAP communications. This is one of the reasons that getting and using your CAP email will make things easier.)

---
Consider personalizing this, adding some context for why you are interested in the ES discipline, and maybe a sentence about follow-ups by meeting or email.


At the next squadron meeting, find a minute to ask your squadron commander about getting started. 

You should get a series of emails once the commander goes in and approves your specialty tracks.

Once that is done, it's time to take the training in e-Services.

You can drop yourself right at the learning section of e-Services [here](https://capnhq.gov/CAP.LMS.Web/Default.aspx).

Once there, click on the "Go to AXIS" button, which is our current e-learning platform. That may change in the future, in which case you'll choose whatever new button is there.

Click on the Course Catalog tab, and under the drop-down selection choose "Emergency." There will be 5 courses for you to take there. Take them in the order they are presented.

![Pasted image 20240420175249](https://github.com/donaldmorganjr/CAP-ES-Pamphlet/assets/24913461/2094ef90-fce3-453a-a84a-eec87e7c629c)

Some of the materials may feel like repetition of the courses you've taken from FEMA. That is because some of them were designed before the FEMA courses were fully implemented. Getting them all out of the way now is a good idea.

Now we're going to talk about Communications.

Comms in CAP has a fascinating history ranging from the military issuing radios to coastal patrol stations, to members building their own radios, to a point where the FCC would grant custom call signs to CAP members. 

Today, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) no longer governs CAP communications. That role is provided by the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration), which governs the use of among other things, military communications. We are issued radios that have encryption plugs (though we don't use them by default, only when specified for the mission), digital modes, and operate on military frequencies. 

You may have an amateur radio license and feel like you can use your personal radio for CAP missions. You cannot. We do not operate under FCC Amateur Radio or MARS (Military Auxiliary Radio Service) rules. Attempting to do so can cause issues for many people down the road. The exceptions to using amateur radios during CAP operations are:

1. Using Amateur Radio frequencies with your personal radio for personal purposes during breaks
2. Using ANY frequencies for IMMEDIATE lifesaving operations. Note: using that IMMEDIACY justification will require documentation after the fact to at least the following groups:
	1. Your chain of command
	2. The FCC
	3. The NTIA

With that in mind, use common sense and the tools you are issued along with the following communications training to set your path.

Note: If you have a FCC issued General Radiotelephone Operator License (GROL) this will [qualify you for advancement to 1st LT](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R_355_D1A3C2A66AF7A.pdf) after completion of your Education and Training modules in Level 1 and Level 2 Part 1. The GROL will eventually be a requirement for the Communications Unit Leader (CUL, being rebranded as COML so you'll see both acronyms) so it is something to keep in mind if you are going down the Communications track as your primary goal.

The first tier of communications training is called ICUT, or "Introductory Communications User Training." The NTIA requires that all members using radios meet that minimum level of training or be immediately supervised by a person meeting that minimum training.

It's divided into 3 sections:

T1 - T for Training - 6 lessons
OP1 - OP for Operations - 2 lessons
OP2 - OP for Operations again - 2 lessons

Upon completing those classes, ask your squadron commander to schedule time with your communications officer to take the practical (hands-on) portion of the tests. 

Radios can feel intimidating to use for many people the first time you use them. Do not worry, this happens with many people and our purpose when we test you isn't to judge you, but to help you get to the point where you can effectively use the radios.

---

With all of the above done, you are getting close to being deployable on missions as a trainee. There are a few housekeeping things left to do though.

First, you need to get a photo of yourself to put on your ID card. The rules for photos are [here](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/members/cap-national-hq/member-services/membership-card-guide).
Upload your photo, ask your commander to approve it. Done.

Now, you need to make sure you have 4 documents with you for every mission.

1. Your CAP Membership Card.
2. Your CAP [Form 101](https://capnhq.gov/CAP.OPSQuals.Web/EmergencyServices/101Card.aspx) Card.
	1. This is automatically generated from your e-Services record. Type in your CAPID, hit enter, then at the bottom of the page hit "click here to print."
	2. As you qualify for more work types, more items will appear on this card.
3. Your CAP [Form 160](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/F160_158EAB9B13D02.pdf) (2 copies).
	1. You'll need to carefully fill this out.
4. Your CAP [Form 161](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/F161_023ECA81C03FB.pdf) (2 copies).
	1. You'll need to carefully fill this out.

The 2nd copy of your 160 and 161 should be in a well sealed manila envelope. Label the envelope with your name, CAPID, contact number and a line that says: CONTENTS, FORM 160, FORM 161. DO NOT OPEN EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. This is what you'll give to your mission base when you check in to an incident. You'll take it back with you when you demobilize and check out of the incident. You'll keep your other copies and documents DIRECTLY ON YOUR PERSON, not in a bag or pack. A ziplock bag is suggested to help keep them dry in adverse weather.

Note: Your local squadron/group/wing may have a different policy on the above paperwork. When in doubt, ask your commander during training cycles rather than on your first live mission on how things should be done.

---

Now let's talk about the first thing you should train for. There are many job types during a mission, and some are more important than others. A partial list of those jobs are:

Airborne Photographer (AP) 
Air Operations Branch Director (AOBD) 
Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
Communications Unit Leader (CUL) 
Flight Line Marshaller (FLM) 
Flight Line Supervisor (FLS) 
Ground Branch Director (GBD) 
Ground Team Member (GTM) – Any Level 
Ground Team Leader 
Incident Commander (IC) – Any Level 
Mission Observer (MO) 
Mission Radio Officer (MRO) 
Mission Safety Officer (MSO)
Mission Staff Assistant (MSA)
Mission Scanner (MS) 
Operations Section Chief (OSC) 
Planning Section Chief (PSC) 
Search and Rescue/Disaster Relief Mission Pilot (MP)
Transport Mission Pilot (TMP) 
Urban Direction Finding Team (UDF)

Before you try to figure out where you will start, I'll make it simple for you.

The first thing that needs to happen with every mission: A mission base must be established. The working arm of the mission base is the Mission Staff Assistant (MSA).

Those of you with an ICS background or who paid attention during the FEMA classes might be initially confused. There is no MSA anywhere in the FEMA training! What was the point of all that training if we are going to come up with our own names for things?!

Well, it turns out that this position IS in that training, it's just hiding. But the eventual ICS300 class you will take spells it out:

![Pasted image 20240420184049](https://github.com/donaldmorganjr/CAP-ES-Pamphlet/assets/24913461/5029faa6-1195-485a-a1cc-e7a81ac0158f)


Perhaps from this you can immediately see how beneficial assistants on a mission base can be. The MSA is the very definition of "all other tasks assigned" when missions are starting up or closing down, rapidly setting up registration and staging areas, escorting people to different locations, taking notes for people, organizing logistics, and setting up the coffee maker.

So what you'll want to do is request permission from your commander to begin MSA training. The easiest way to do this is in e-Services [here](https://capnhq.gov/CAP.OPSQuals.Web/EmergencyServices/SQTR.aspx).

Type in your CAPID and hit enter. You'll see two dropdown menus next to each other. Choose MSA from the second dropdown menu:
![Pasted image 20240420184602](https://github.com/donaldmorganjr/CAP-ES-Pamphlet/assets/24913461/c34d88ad-73d8-462e-a5cb-508f9d1ee337)


And you'll see a bunch of information underneath this populate.

This is the CAP version of the Position Task Book you'll hear other agencies use. Ours are online with the exception of certain ones under active development.

![Pasted image 20240420185140](https://github.com/donaldmorganjr/CAP-ES-Pamphlet/assets/24913461/b15382c9-838d-4821-a0cd-b6b055aa3651)


Congratulations! You know now how to fill out your task book online!

Now repeat this for the next commander approval item that says "Commander Approval for Familiarization and Preparatory Training."

These items will switch from grey to yellow and say PENDING until your commander goes into e-Services and approves them. Then they will turn green.

Note you may also print out hard copies of your task book using the drop down at the bottom center of the image where it says "Print MSA SQTR" (Specialty Qualification Training Record, if you're curious about the acronym.) This can be useful when you are getting training in the middle of nowhere with no online access. 

With that in mind, let's talk about trainers for a second.

You cannot simply receive training from anyone in CAP and get credit for that training. Credited training requires that you be taught, or have the teaching be observed by a Skills Evaluator. Only individuals who have:
1. Held a qualification for at least one year
2. Completed The Skills Evaluator Training (SET) class
3. Been approved by the wing as an Evaluator for that Qualification
Can approve your training as validated on your taskbook.

You can look up if the person training you is an evaluator by pulling up their CAPID in e-Services [here](https://capnhq.gov/CAP.OPSQuals.Web/EmergencyServices/101Card.aspx).

You'll see the front and back of their 101 card. On the back of the card, if they have a diamond next to their qualification, they are a Skills Evaluator.

Here is an example:

![Pasted image 20240420185807](https://github.com/donaldmorganjr/CAP-ES-Pamphlet/assets/24913461/b73de82b-82ba-4542-a305-c9001947f4f5)

As you can see, this record shows a member is a skills evaluator for MSA. But they are a trainee for several other areas, and so the only thing they can approve for you here are tasks in the MSA task book.

Now let's go through the MSA tasks. If you printed the copy of your MSA task book, it will look like this:

![Pasted image 20240420190449](https://github.com/donaldmorganjr/CAP-ES-Pamphlet/assets/24913461/5aed6b28-15fb-4496-8742-34b76ff84b7b)

Look at that. 15 tasks to do, and because you followed this guide, 7 of them are already done.

Now you're probably asking yourself, "How do I learn the rest of these?"

All of the CAP tasks are defined in 3 books:

[The Mission Base Staff Guide](https://nesa.cap.gov/media/cms/Mission_Base_Staff_Tasks_Guide_6C11E36F85477.pdf)
[The Ground & Urban Direction Finding Team Tasks Guide](https://nesa.cap.gov/media/cms/GUDFTG_16F2489D24A32.pdf)
	This is supplemented by the [Ground Team Member & Leader Reference Text](https://nesa.cap.gov/media/cms/GTRT_85670BD1C7D98.pdf)
[Aircrew & Flightline Tasks Guide](https://nesa.cap.gov/media/cms/ACFLTG__11_Apr_05_C1347D337C4C6_8CC8922C64C17.pdf)

Since the MSA is a Mission Base job, We'll click on the Mission Base Staff Guide link. These are searchable PDFs, so hit CONTROL+F, type in the code for the first task to do (P-2006) and you'll get the description, the testing method, and the pass/fail conditions for evaluation.

After your Evaluator signs you off on this task, you may proceed to train for the rest of the tasks. These may be done in person during squadron meetings, or during training missions.

The best supplemental training you can give yourself for the MSA Qualification is the following FEMA class: [IS-201: Forms Used for the Development of the Incident Action Plan](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-201&lang=en) followed by a review of the actual forms themselves [here](https://training.fema.gov/icsresource/icsforms.aspx). Remember, even though CAP is mostly online for incident management, you may need to use paper forms between data being entered into our mission management system or you may be assigned to another agency and need to use their forms or data entry systems. The most common system you will run into is called WebEOC. A basic training module on using it can be found [here](https://cdp.dhs.gov/training/course/AWR-942-W).

==Warning: Boring stuff ahead. But this stuff doesn't matter until it matters, and then it matters a lot!==

Let's talk about missions for a minute. This is probably stuff you've never had to care about before unless you've had prior public safety training.

There are two main types of missions in CAP. Training missions, and live missions. From there, the classification of mission type can determine several factors up to and including liability. For a quick introduction to what that means, hop on over to [CAPR 900-5, THE CAP INSURANCE/BENEFITS PROGRAM.](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R900_005_8F2514161E982.pdf)
When you are participating in CAP activities, you MAY be covered by varying degrees of insurance for various circumstances. Like all insurance, there are both exclusions and rules to follow for coverage.

What makes CAP unique from nearly all other volunteer organizations is that we may be assigned a mission status by either CAP the Corporation or we may be assigned Air Force Assigned Mission (AFAM) status. In that latter circumstance, we are operating fully as civilian members of the Department of the Air Force and if over the age of 18 covered by certain Federal rules rather than by private insurance. I suggest you read the regulation carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities under both mission types.

In some states, you might be assigned a mission number by both CAP and a local agency requesting support. That can result in certain coinsurance issues that may be covered in a memorandum or a letter of understanding between those agencies and CAP. Again, read the appropriate documentation carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities when that occurs.

The fastest way to identify the mission coverage is by the [Mission Symbol](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/S_072002_0C903A92F129D.pdf). You'll locate this when you are told what the mission number is upon assignment.

Ok, the boring stuff is out of the way. Now let's pretend for a minute that your phone rings, and your commander is asking for you to go on a mission. Hurray! This is the moment you've been waiting for!

Now hold on for a moment. Take a step back and ask some questions. Hopefully this is information being given to you (start writing on a notepad or computer!) but ask them for the following information:

1. Who is the mission Point of Contact (POC) and what is their Contact Information?
2. What is the Mission Number?
3. What type of Event/Incident is it?
4. What is the location you will report in at?
5. What is the expected date/time you should be reporting in at?
6. What equipment is required to bring with me?
7. What method of transportation should I take?
8. What route should I take there?
9. What is the expected length of operations?
10. What safety issues not covered by the above questions should I be aware of?

Now that you've got that out of the way, it's time to ask yourself some personal questions.

1. Am I safe to deploy?
	1. Pilots use something called the [IAMSAFE checklist](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/IMSAFE_Checklist_6D670F6399B3B.pdf). It's a good framework to consider, though everyone has their own personal, subjective metrics they use. Remember: There is no mission so critical that requires that you deploy when you aren't safe to do so. There is a phrase known as the "incident within the incident" and that is something you never want to be at the center of.
2. Check the weather for your location, your route, and your destination. Dress and pack accordingly.
3. If you have dietary restrictions, allergies, or other issues that can impact a mission, pack appropriate mitigations into your gear. 
4. Inspect your method of transportation for safety before heading out.
6. Add to this checklist any things you might consider needful.

While not strictly necessary, send an email to your POC letting them know you are on your way, your route, and your projected ETA.

Upon the completion of two Sorties and the completion of all tasks successfully evaluated, you will have met the requirements to be a MSA without supervision on a mission site. This will make you a fully deployable asset for your squadron along with completing several major milestones on your Emergency Services Specialty Track.

Let's talk about that for a minute.

I've put the required items into a spreadsheet instead of the checklist online to simplify tracking. It looks like this:

![Pasted image 20240420201509](https://github.com/donaldmorganjr/CAP-ES-Pamphlet/assets/24913461/d0de48fa-bdc3-4c26-8415-e6f5811e728b)


If you've been following along, you've accomplished 6 things on this checklist already! With the exception of more training missions and time in service, everything else on here can be accomplished in a collaborative format with your current mentor. Upon all items being completed, your mentor will forward this to your commander for approval and you will be awarded the Emergency Services Badge, and the Technician Rating in Emergency Services.

One last thing: Your completion of your first qualification rating (not specialty track rating) also qualifies you to wear the [Emergency Services Patch](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/R035_006_70213217D50CA.pdf). But, like other items here, you must process the request into e-Services to officially record this into your record. Go [here](https://capnhq.gov/CAP.OPSQuals.Web/Ratings/RatingsAwardsBadges.aspx) and put in your CAPID, and towards the bottom of the list, select "CAP Emergency Services Patch" and submit the request. That will go to your commander for approval.

This concludes my basic pamphlet for getting you up and running as fast as possible in ES.

This is a rough draft that a friend of mine asked me to put together, so please report any errors, questions, comments, and concerns to donald.morgan@wawg.cap.gov, and if for some reason you cannot get a local mentor in Emergency Services, please reach out to me after conferring with your unit commander if they are ok with you using a virtual mentor.

Before I let you go, I'll quote CAPR 60-3 2-1 Paragraph b once again with regards to training:

=="Training should not stop with initial qualification since professional performance demands continuous training."==

Other non-CAP resources you can take training from to further your education include:

[Texas A&M Extension Institute's DHS/FEMA funded classes (online and resident)](https://teex.org/dhs-fema-funded/) 

[Interagency Aviation Training](https://www.iat.gov/)

[FEMA Continuity Excellence Series](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/national-preparedness/continuity/excellence-series)

And of course, every state has their own training calendar. If you can't find your state's training calendar, please reach out to your wing ES Director or email me for details.

Other important resources you can research to help see where CAP can fit in to your state or local area's emergency response plans include:

Looking up your State Emergency Operations Plan
Looking up your County or City plan (Sometimes referred to as a "Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan")
Knowing which laws in your state are applicable to Emergency Services, volunteers, and non-profit organizations
Identifying your local volunteer coordinator for your city and county.
Joining your local [VOAD (Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOAD) to meet other groups and coordinate with them before disaster strikes
Identifying your [Local Emergency Planning Committee](https://www.epa.gov/epcra/local-emergency-planning-committees) to see where CAP can appropriately support your area.
I also suggest signing up for the [FEMA Daily Operations Briefing](https://service.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSFEMA/subscriber/topics) to keep an eye on major events across the USA.
